#### Steps to run the app & Test:
- Download the project code, preferably using `git clone`.
- Open the Android SDK Manager (*Tools* Menu | *Android*) and make sure you have installed the *Android testing support library Repository* under *Extras*.
- In Android Studio, select *File* | *Open...* and point to the `./build.gradle` file.
- Check out the relevant code:
    * The application under test is located in `src/main/java`
    * Tests are in `src/androidTest/java`
- Create the test configuration with a custom runner: `android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`
    * Open *Run* menu | *Edit Configurations*
    * Add a new *Android Tests* configuration
    * Choose a module
    * Add a *Specific instrumentation runner*: `android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`

    (On your device, under Settings->Developer options disable the following 3 settings: "Window animation scale", "Transition animation scale" and "Animator duration scale")
- Run the newly created configuration

The application will be started on the device/emulator and a series of actions will be performed automatically.
